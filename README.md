# holesail-termux
A script to build and install Holesail in termux. It is based on: https://github.com/holesail/holesail/issues/21#issuecomment-2455157536

Steps:

1. On your Android device, intall the Termux app
2. Open termux and run: " sh < (curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jjacke13/holesail-termux/refs/heads/main/holesail.sh) "
3. Be patient and read and follow the instructions when it asks you stuff.
4. Enjoy!


PS. 
I have tested this script on Google Pixel 8a runnning Graphene OS (with Android 15) and Termux installed from F-droid. 
If you have time, please try it on your device and report here :)
